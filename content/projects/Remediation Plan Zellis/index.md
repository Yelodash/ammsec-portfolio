### Project Overview

Created a **practice remediation plan** based on a simulated cyber incident affecting a payroll and HR services provider, inspired by the real-world MOVEit Transfer vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362).

This project was completed **for learning and portfolio purposes only**. All figures, costs, timelines, and scenarios are **fictitious** and were used solely to demonstrate structured cybersecurity and risk management skills.

The work showcases my ability to translate a complex cyber incident into a **clear, business-focused remediation plan**, covering governance, risk, compliance, and control improvement in a regulated HR and payroll environment.

#### 1. Key Highlights

- **Root Cause Analysis**  
    Identified people, process, and technology weaknesses that contributed to the simulated breach.
- **Threat & Asset Mapping**  
    Linked critical business assets (payroll systems, file-transfer platforms, identity systems) to relevant cyber threats in a clear and structured way.
- **Risk Assessment & Prioritisation**  
    Applied recognised industry standards (ISO 27005 and CVSS) to assess risk severity and prioritise remediation actions.
- **Control Design & Oversight**  
    Designed practical security controls such as multi-factor authentication, role-based access, patch management, security monitoring, and supplier assurance, with measurable KPIs for accountability.
- **Business Impact Analysis**  
    Demonstrated how improved controls reduce financial, operational, and regulatory risk using both qualitative and quantitative methods.
- **Continuous Improvement**  
    Embedded lessons learned into an ongoing review cycle to ensure long-term improvement rather than one-off fixes.

#### 2.Results

- **Reduced Risk Exposure**  
    High-risk scenarios were reduced to acceptable levels through targeted controls.
- **Improved Operational Resilience**  
    Stronger monitoring, access controls, and supplier governance help protect sensitive payroll and HR data.
- **Regulatory Alignment**  
    Approach aligned with ISO 27001 principles and UK GDPR Article 32 expectations.
- **Measurable Improvements**  
    Examples include full adoption of multi-factor authentication, improved patch compliance, and significantly faster incident detection times.
